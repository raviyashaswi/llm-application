**Summarize Large Files Using Grok LLM**

This repository demonstrates how to utilize Grok LLM to efficiently summarize large files by splitting them into manageable chunks, processing each chunk, and aggregating insights. It is designed for users who need to extract key information from extensive textual data using modern language models.

## Features

- **Chunked Summarization**: Breaks large files into smaller pieces for efficient processing.
- **Grok LLM Integration**: Uses Grok LLM to generate concise summaries.
- **Multi-language Support**: Built primarily in Python, with JavaScript for UI, and HTML/CSS for presentation.
- **Extensible Design**: Easily adapt to other LLMs or file types.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core logic and backend.
- **JavaScript**: Frontend interactivity.
- **HTML/CSS**: UI/UX styling.
- **Grok LLM**: Language model for summarization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Grok LLM API credentials (or an equivalent setup)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raviyashaswi/llm-application.git
   cd llm-application
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Configure Grok LLM**
   - Add your Grok LLM API key or credentials in the configuration file (see `config.py` or relevant env setup).

### Usage

- Place your large text files in the `input` directory.
- Run the summarization script:
  ```bash
  python main.py input/large_file.txt
  ```
- Summaries will be generated and saved in the `output` directory.

### Example

```python
from grok_llm import summarize_large_file

summary = summarize_large_file('input/large_file.txt')
print(summary)
```

### Web Interface

Launch the frontend to upload files and view summaries:

```bash
npm start
```
